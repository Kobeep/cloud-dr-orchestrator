# Encryption Configuration Example
# Copy this file to /etc/cloud-dr-orchestrator/encryption.env or ~/.backup-encryption.env

# ENCRYPTION KEY
# Generate with: orchestrator keygen
# CRITICAL: Store securely! Lost key = lost backups!
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-base64-encoded-256-bit-key-here

# Alternative: Password-based encryption
# Less secure than generated key, but easier to remember
# BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=MyVerySecureP@ssw0rd!2024

# Key Management Best Practices:
# 1. Use environment variables (not hardcoded in scripts)
# 2. Use secret managers in production (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
# 3. Rotate keys periodically
# 4. Keep backup of keys in secure location
# 5. Never commit keys to version control

# Usage Examples:

# Backup with encryption:
#   export $(cat /etc/cloud-dr-orchestrator/encryption.env | xargs)
#   orchestrator backup --encrypt --name prod --db-name mydb ...

# Or pass key directly:
#   orchestrator backup --encrypt --encryption-key "$BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY" ...

# Restore with automatic decryption (.encrypted files):
#   orchestrator restore --file backup.tar.gz.encrypted --db-name mydb ...

# Restore with forced decryption:
#   orchestrator restore --decrypt --decryption-key "$BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY" --file backup.tar.gz ...
